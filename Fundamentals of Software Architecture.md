- Architecture
    - hard to define
    - is about the important stuff
- Software Architect
    - in the past

        (e.g. metrics, styles, validations, …)
    - needs to know
        - structure of the system
        - architecture characteristics
            - characteristic that the system must supports 
            (e.g. availability, scalability, agility, …)
        - architecture decisions
            - define the rules for how a system should be constructed
        - design principles
            - guideline for developing a system
