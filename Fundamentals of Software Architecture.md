## CH01. Introduction

- Architecture
    - hard to define
    - is about the important stuff
- Software Architect
    - in the past
        - only dealt with the purely technical aspects of architecture
        (e.g. modularity, components, patterns, …)
    - now
        - role of architect has expanded
        (e.g. metrics, styles, validations, …)
    - needs to know
        - structure of the system
        - architecture characteristics
            - characteristic that the system must supports 
            (e.g. availability, scalability, agility, …)
        - architecture decisions
            - define the rules for how a system should be constructed
        - design principles
            - guideline for developing a system
- Expectations of an Architect
    - Make architecture decisions
        - guide technology decisions (not choose a specific technology)
    - Continually analyze the architecture
        - continually analyze the architecture and current technology environment
        - then recommend solutions for improvement
    - Keep current with latest trends
        - understanding and following key trends helps the architect prepare for the future and make the correct decision
    - Ensure compliance with decisions
    - Diverse exposure and experience
    - Have business domain knowledge
        - w/o knowing business domain, it is difficult to make a decision
    - Possess interpersonal skills
    - Understand and navigate politics
- Laws of Software Architecture
    - Everything in software architecture is a “trade-off”
    - Why is more important than how
