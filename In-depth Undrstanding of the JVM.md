## CH02. Java Memory Areas and Memory Overflow

- Runtime Data Area
    - Program Counter (PC) Register
        - bytecode line number indicator of current thread
        - located at thread private memory (independent memory of each thread)
    - JVM Stack
        - push stack frame into JVM Stack when a method starts
        - pop stack frame from JVM Stack when the method ends
        - size of local variables is fixed during compile time
    - Native Method Stack
        - similar to JVM Stack
        - external library codes (os, hardware, ...)
    - Java Heap
        - shared by all threads
        - almost of instances are stored at heap
        - managed by gc
    - Method Area
        - shared by all threads
        - constants, static variables, ...
        - runtime constant pool (strings, literals, ...)
